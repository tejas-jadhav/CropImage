# CropImage

Crop an image !

The image is cropped using [Andriod-Image-Cropper](https://github.com/CanHub/Android-Image-Cropper) dependency !

Things I learnt while working on this project
- ViewBinding in Activities and Fragments
- Using multiple fragments and using the supportFragmentManager to switch between fragments
- Starting an activity that provides a result using the new ActivityContracts API
- Deleting files stored in external directory
- Creating Alert Dialog box
